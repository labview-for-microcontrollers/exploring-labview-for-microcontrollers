# Exploring LabVIEW for Microcontrollers

This is a project for exploring and prototyping possibilities for for open source tools to deploy LabVIEW code to various microcontrollers (e.g. the Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040 and others).

There have been a variety of projects and related work done on this effort by different people over the years. Here we will start by taking inventory on the work done by others, discuss possibilities, experiment with ideas, develop prototypes, and a share a roadmap toward making this a real capability for LabVIEW developers!

### Various Projects and Products

*   [NI LabVIEW C Generator](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview-c-generator-module.html#322515) - an add-on for LabVIEW from NI that helps you create C code from LabVIEW VIs for specific targets.
*   [NI VireoSDK](https://github.com/ni/VireoSDK) - a compact runtime written in C++ for a subset of LabVIEW, which is maintained by NI. Â It runs VI Assembly (VIA) which are an output of LabVIEW (NXG) Web UI Builder. It can be compiled to various environments including Windows, Mac, Linux, JavaScript, and others.
*   [Raspberry Pi Compatible Compiler for LabVIEW](https://github.com/labviewforRaspi/LabVIEWforRasPi) - A seemingly inactive project/product for compiling LabVIEW code to Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 3B+, 4B were not supported)
*   [Arduino Compatible Compiler for LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/tools-network/download.arduino--compatible-compiler-for-labview.html#379003) - A commercial product for compiling LabVIEW code to the Arduino
*   [TylorH C code Generator for LabVIEW](https://github.com/taylorh140/LabVIEWCGen) - A very elementary C code generator for LabVIEW (move of a simple proof of concept)
*   [LabVIEW Hobbyist Toolkit (Linx)](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/tools-network/download.labview-hobbyist-toolkit.html#376574) - This is an add-on for LabVIEW that deploys to linux systems (like Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone) that can run the NI Linux RT OS.
